                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Main Course</h2>
                <p class="center">The main course is food that is served as the main dish in a multi-course meal. It is
                    often served after the entrée. In the United States, the main course may be called the "entrée". The
                    main course is usually the biggest dish on a menu. The main ingredient is often meat or fish. It
                    most often follows an appetizer, soup, or salad, and is often followed by a dessert.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Desserts</h2>
                <p class="center">Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course consists of sweet foods, such as
                    confections, and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine and liqueur. In some parts of the world,
                    such as much of Central Africa and West Africa, and most parts of China, there is no tradition of a
                    dessert course to conclude a meal.</p>
